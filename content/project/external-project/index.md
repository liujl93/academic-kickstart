This project developed methods for inference in spatio-temporal models that allow for locally stationarity.  A novel spatio-temporal distance expanding (STED) asymptotic framework on a fixed domain is proposed to study local stationarity. Some examples of spatio-temporal models including zero-mean Gaussian process model and simple linear regression model are studied. In particular, we consider a semiparametric model and develop a profile likelihood method. A cross-validation bandwidth selection procedure based on bimodal kernel is proposed to address the effect of correlated errors. The theoretical properties for the profile likelihood estimators, and as a by-product, for MLE in zero-mean and simple linear models, are established, including consistency and asymptotic normality. We demonstrate the finite sample properties of our estimation procedure via simulations and a real data example.
