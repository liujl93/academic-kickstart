#My research broadly focuses on the interplay between statistics, probability, and computation, particularly as they apply to high-dimensional Bayesian models and Monte Carlo methods. I enjoy working on both theoretical and applied projects, and find them to often illuminate each other.

#I spent the 2018 summer working as a research intern at Oculus Research, in the eye-tracking team. Before coming to Stanford, I received a Masters in Mathematics and BSc in Economics, both from PUC-Rio, in Brazil.
