#My doctoral research focuses on 1) developing statistical and mathematical methodologies and theory for analyzing spatial and spatio-temporal data; 2) investigating computationally intensive algorithms to compute maximum likelihood estimates for a class of spatial models; 3) applying methodologies to solve statistical problems that arise in environmental sciences and public health.

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at Colorado State University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Haonan Wang](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~wanghn/).
Before coming to CSU, I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/index.html).

My doctoral research focuses on 1) developing statistical and mathematical methodologies and theory for analyzing spatial and spatio-temporal data; 2) investigating computationally intensive algorithms to compute maximum likelihood estimates for a class of spatial models; 3) applying methodologies to solve statistical problems that arise in environmental sciences and public health.

I enjoy working on theory, algorithm and practice of statistical methods and find them to often inspire each other. I am also involved in exciting interdisciplinary collaborations here at CSU with ecologists, aimed at quantifying the influence of landscape complexity on species diversity of spiders.
