In this post, I did a summary of commonly used time series techniques based on two Posts [Time series analysis in Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Yorko/mlcourse_open/blob/master/jupyter_english/topic09_time_series/topic9_part1_time_series_python.ipynb?flush_cache=true) and [Time Series Analysis (TSA) in Python - Linear Models to GARCH](http://www.blackarbs.com/blog/time-series-analysis-in-python-linear-models-to-garch/11/1/2016).

Please refer to this [notebook](http://liujl93.github.io/files/IntroTS.html).
